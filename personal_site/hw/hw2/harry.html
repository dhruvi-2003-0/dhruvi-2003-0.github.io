  <p>DESIGN – This website has an amazing black and white themed sleek background with pixel computer theme letters as the font. Overall its an amazing design.</p>
  <p>USABILITY – Its pretty easy to use for all ages as it has all information listed with a menu on top also.</p>
  <p>CONTENT – Content is very well covered including all the details about this person and the work and projects he has done. The services and capability part of the website is the best personally for me as it has information on the left and a small animation on the right.</p>
  <p>CREATIVITY – Nice ideas used for the page and the interactivity of the page with animations and pictures.</p>
