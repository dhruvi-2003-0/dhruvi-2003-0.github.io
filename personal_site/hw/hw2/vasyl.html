  <p>DESIGN – The design is amazing and going well along with the theme of the
  website that is a 3D art gallery.</p>
  <p>USABILITY – This website would be tough to use by the elderly people. It would
  be a little difficult for them to figure out what to do next. But his website
  compromises an art gallery mostly for young painters and visitors to see his
  work, so its pretty easy for them to handle the website</p>
  <p>CONTENT – It is a more of a visual website because he is showing his art works.
  But the page listed about him has content very well executed.</p>
  <p>CREATIVITY – The creativity of this website is unique and amazing. The way the
  cursor is used and the art pieces in background going perfectly with the font. Its
  also having a very subtle nice theme to the website.</p>
