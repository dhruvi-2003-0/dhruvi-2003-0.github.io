  <p>DESIGN – The design overall is pretty good and sleek. It has a good color combination used which catches a persons eye. The website has a very well layout.</p>

  <p>USABILITY – This website is nicely designed to be used by kids, teens, adults and
  elderly people too. It is an ideal website which can be used by all.</p>
  <p>CONTENT – This website has information regarding web design in London. It has
  enough amount of information nicely spaced out in the website to get an idea to
  the viewer.</p>
  <p>CREATIVITY – I personally like the starting look of the page which has a painting
  that moves with your cursor moving on the screen. Even the Design Projects part
  of website is really catchy with the eye designed cursor to have a further look
  into it.</p>
